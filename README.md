# React-Weather
Responsive react site using data from OpenWeatherMap. Responsive CSS, horizontal scrolling using third party libraries, loading animations.

User can search for a city/zip code, city + state, and even city + state + country. Works for cities outside of the US. Centers map on searched city. 

Functionality for Daily/Extended forecast is not implemented because I lack the premium API key needed.
